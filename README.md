A Line Follower Robot is an autonomous machine designed to navigate and follow a pre-determined path, typically a black line on a white surface or vice versa. Equipped with sensors, usually infrared or optical, this robot detects the contrast between the line and the background, allowing it to stay on course. As it moves, the sensors continuously send feedback to a microcontroller, which processes the data and adjusts the robot's direction accordingly. The primary applications of line follower robots include educational purposes, where they help students understand the basics of robotics and control systems, and industrial environments, where they are used for material transport and automated guided vehicle (AGV) systems. These robots exemplify fundamental principles of automation and control, making them an excellent entry point for learning about robotics.
